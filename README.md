# ðŸ“ˆ StockWatch (Working Title)

**StockWatch** is a side project I'm building in my spare time while working full-time.

The goal of this app is to provide a clean, mobile-friendly way to track stock market movements. It will allow users to:

- View the top 2 gainers and losers of the day
- Search for stocks by name or ticker symbol
- View historical price charts for individual stocks
- [More features to come...]

## ðŸ”§ About this version

This is an early version focused on UI prototyping and architecture setup.  
**The UI is provisional** and will likely change as the app evolves.
